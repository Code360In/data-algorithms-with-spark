### [Book: Data Algorithms with Spark by Mahmoud Parsian](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Algorithms-Spark-Recipes-Patterns/dp/1492082384/ref=asc_df_1492082384/)

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
When I started the Apache Spark project a decade ago, 
one of my main goals was to make it easier for a wide 
range of users to implement parallel algorithms. New 
algorithms acting on large-scale data are having a 
profound impact in all areas of computing, and I wanted 
to help developers implement new algorithms and reason 
about their performance without having to build a 
distributed system from scratch.

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
I am therefore very excited to see this new book by 
Dr. Mahmoud Parsian on data algorithms with Spark. 
Dr. Parsian has extensive research and practical 
experience with large-scale data-parallel algorithms,
including developing new algorithms for bioinformatics 
as the lead of Illumina’s big data team. In this book, 
he introduces Spark through its Python API, PySpark, 
and shows how to implement a wide range of useful algorithms
efficiently using Spark’s distributed computing primitives. 
He also explains the workings of the underlying Spark engine
and how to optimize your algorithms through techniques such
as controlling data partitioning. This book will be a great
resource for both readers looking to implement existing 
algorithms in a scalable fashion and readers who are developing 
new, custom algorithms using Spark.

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
I am also thrilled that Dr. Parsian has included working 
code examples for all the algorithms he discusses, using 
real-world problems where possible. These will serve as a 
great starting point for readers who want to implement 
similar computations. Whether you intend to use these 
algorithms directly or build your own, custom algorithms 
using Spark, I hope that you enjoy this book as an introduction 
to the open-source engine, its inner workings, and the modern 
parallel algorithms that are having such a broad impact across computing.
